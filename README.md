<h1>Data Exploration And Analysis</h1>

This is part of a group, final project from **"data analytics with Python" class**, written by me.<br>

<h3>Some requirements that were given by professor:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Goal</b>:Detect three interesting, nontrivial,and somewhat unexpected findings in a real-world data set of your choice.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Managerial insights</b>: answer the “So what?” question.  That is, convince the reader that your finding can be used to improve operations and increase 
profit.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Information:</h3>
 Me and my team decided to work on <a href = 'https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset'>this data set</a>.<br><br> 
 I uploaded only code that was written by me. I performed data cleaning and data wrangling and I did one of the findings. You will find 2 jupyter notebooks and 2 data files inside of this project. <br>
 <b>Jupyter notebooks:</b> the first jupyter notebook is for data cleaning and data wrangling. The second jupyter notebook is for findings.<br>
 <b>Data files:</b> data file in <i>root/data/raw_data</i> folder is data that was downloaded from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/">kaggle</a>.
 Second data file in <i>root/data/processed_data</i> folder is output of data cleaning and wrangling we performed analysis on.
<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Do not run "Data Cleaning.ipynb" file. It will take  long time to process. The output of this code is presented as a separate file.</li>
  <li>To run "Python Final Project.ipynb" unzip data located <a href = "https://github.com/Sergey1838/Data_Exploration_And_Analysis/tree/master/data/processed_data">root/data/processed_data</a>.</li>
</ol>
